## About Me

Greetings! I'm Lydia Lorien, a digital explorer with a background in digital forensics and cryptography. I once walked alongside **Anonymous**, but now I navigate the digital landscape as an independent seeker of truths hidden within lines of code.

## Cryptic Pursuits

Cryptic languages and encryption have been my playground. I've delved into the chaotic beauty of Malbolge and decoded intricate cryptographic puzzles. My skills reflect the convergence of curiosity and technical prowess.

## Beyond the Binary

Beyond the ones and zeroes, I'm an intellectual wanderer. "Intellectual Pursuits," a repository of mine, houses philosophical inquiries, academic explorations, and linguistic musings that mirror my inquisitive nature.
